# DRC-GIS-Topography
# Topographical Maps of DRC Provinces

## Overview

This repository contains a GIS project aimed at creating detailed topographical maps of selected provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The project focuses on visualizing different elevations across the provinces of Equateur, Maniema, Haut-Katanga, Kongo-Central, North-Kivu, and Tshopo. The primary objective is to enhance GIS skills through practical application.

## Project Details

### Objectives

- **Create Topographical Maps**: Develop maps showcasing the elevation variations across the DRC provinces.
- **Enhance GIS Skills**: Use this exercise to practice and improve GIS techniques and methodologies.
- **Visualize Elevation Data**: Represent elevation data for better spatial understanding and analysis.

### Provinces Covered

- **Equateur**: Map displaying elevation variations in the Equateur province.
- **Maniema**: Topographical map illustrating elevation differences in Maniema.
- **Haut-Katanga**: Map highlighting varying elevations in Haut-Katanga.
- **Kongo-Central**: Topographical representation of Kongo-Central's elevations.
- **North-Kivu**: Elevation map for the North-Kivu province.
